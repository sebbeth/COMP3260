Create six classes:
	Application
	AES
	AES1
	AES2
	AES3
	AES4

Class method structure:
	AES (each variant extends the encrypt/decrypt function to change which methods get called):
		Public - encrypt(128-bit plaintext, 128-bit key), returns array of all round results.
		Public - decrypt(128-bit ciphertext, 128-bit key), returns array of all round results.
		ShiftRows
		MixColumns
		AddRoundKey

	Application (cmd line args accept an input file and the mode of operation (e/d):
		LoadData(loads from file)
		ProcessEncryption - processes initial encryption, along with all 127 variants of Pi and Ki.
		ProcessDecryption - process decryption
		OutputEncryptionResults - outputs the encrypted data, along with all calculated bit differences between base encryption and all variations
		OutputDecryptionResults - outputs the decrypted data
